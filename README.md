### Hi there 👋

I am Harun Mbaabu Mwenda. I am a data engineer with 3+ years of experience designing, building, and maintaining large-scale data systems where I combine my knowledge of software development and data science to build data-driven products that can solve problems and derive insights from the customers and developers. 

A considerable amount of my time is spent doing community work on things that I hope will help humanity in some way and my open-source work is supported by the community. 

**Strong Languages**: JavaScript, Python and c++
  
- 🔭 I’m currently building communities and making tech education accessible regardless of location and the size of the wallets, these communities  includes:  [Data Science  East  Africa ](https://twitter.com/DSEAfrica), [Lux Academy](https://twitter.com/lux_academy), [LuxDevHQ](https://twitter.com/LuxDevHQ) and [Africa Developer's Conference](https://twitter.com/AfricaDevsConf).

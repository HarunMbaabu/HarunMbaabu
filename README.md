### Hi there 👋

My name is Harun Mbaabu Mwenda. I am a senior data analyst, generalist software engineer, senior community manager, and a passionate developer relations engineer. I combine my knowledge of software and data science to build data driven and products that can solve problems and derive insights from the customers and developers. A considerable amount of my time is spent doing unpaid community work on things that I hope will help humanity in some way and my open source work is supported by the community.

**Strong Languages**: JavaScript, Python and c++
